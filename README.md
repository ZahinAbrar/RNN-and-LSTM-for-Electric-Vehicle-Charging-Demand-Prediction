# Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction using RNN

This project focuses on predicting the charging demand for electric vehicles (EVs) using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. Accurate prediction of charging demand is essential for optimizing the energy distribution and management in smart grids, ensuring that EV charging stations meet demand while minimizing energy costs.

## Problem Description

As electric vehicles become more common, managing the energy demand at charging stations is crucial. In this project, we aim to predict future electric vehicle charging demand using historical demand data. This will allow grid operators to make informed decisions regarding energy distribution and charging station management.

## Approach

We use an RNN to model the temporal patterns in the charging demand. RNNs are well-suited for this type of problem because they can capture sequential dependencies in time-series data, which is key for predicting future demand based on past trends.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of historical EV charging data, including the number of EVs charged at a given station at different times.

Each data point includes:
- **Timestamp**: The time when the data was recorded.
- **Charging Demand**: The number of EVs charging at the station during that time.

## RNN Architecture

### Why RNN?
RNNs are a class of neural networks that excel at handling sequential data by maintaining an internal state that captures information about previous time steps. This internal state allows RNNs to model dependencies between past and future values, making them ideal for time series forecasting tasks such as predicting EV charging demand.

### Model Architecture

The RNN architecture used in this project consists of:
1. **Input Layer**: Takes the past demand values as input features.
2. **Recurrent Layer**: A simple RNN or LSTM layer that captures temporal dependencies.
3. **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer to map the RNN output to the predicted charging demand.

Here is a simple architecture used for this project:
- RNN (or LSTM) Layer: 50 units
- Dense Layer: 1 unit for regression output
